# Highlight

What I wanted with this project was to assist me whenever I'm studying on my computer.
I came up with an idea of some overlay application that would cover-up the whole screen and whatever reading material I'm studying, enabling me to highlight stuff and mark other annotations.
I wanted the application to analyze texts on the window below, thus assissting the annotating process.
I wanted all the mouse funtions of scrolling to work as if there was no application above the reading material.
Also, I wanted to store these annotational data along with the reading material in some pictorial form. May be, creating multiple snapshots of the screen for different sections.
